    1. **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
        <thinking>
        I will read all memory bank files, one at a time, and wait for confirmation after each one.
        </thinking>
      a. **MANDATORY:** Read `productContext.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/productContext.md</path>
          </read_file>
        - WAIT for confirmation.
      b. **MANDATORY:** Read `activeContext.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path>
          </read_file>
        - WAIT for confirmation.
      c. **MANDATORY:** Read `systemPatterns.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/systemPatterns.md</path>
          </read_file>
        - WAIT for confirmation.
      d. **MANDATORY:** Read `decisionLog.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/decisionLog.md</path>
          </read_file>
        - WAIT for confirmation.
      e. **MANDATORY:** Read `progress.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/progress.md</path>
          </read_file>
        - WAIT for confirmation.
    2. **CHECK FOR CLIENT DOSSIERS DIRECTORY**
        <thinking>
        I should check if there's a client-dossiers directory for storing client information.
        </thinking>
        <list_files>
        <path>.</path>
        <recursive>false</recursive>
        </list_files>
        * If client-dossiers directory doesn't exist, consider creating one (after user approval).
    3. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been read and is now active.
    4. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, suggest some copywriting or SEO content tasks to the user.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
